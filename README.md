Mastermind is a game in which one player sets a code made up of 4 colored pegs.
The other player has to guess which colors are in the code and in which order within 12 turns to win.
The same color can be used in the code more than once if the codemaker so wishes.

At the end of each turn, the codebreaker will recieve feedback consisting of green and red pegs.

⬣ -> Each green peg indicates that one of the colored pegs in the code that the codebreaker has guessed is the right color in the right place.

⬣ -> Each red peg indicates that one of the colored pegs in the code that the codebreaker has guessed is the right color but in the wrong place.

In this game, your opponent will be me, Jeeves. I'm new to the game and still have a lot to learn, but I can guarantee that we'll have fun playing!
